# Why is git
Git is used to track changes in code and help developers work together without breaking each other’s work.
Example Scenario:
Imagine a team building a website:
A updates the homepage
B adds a contact form
C fixes a bug on the login page
With Git, all their changes can be combined safely, and if a mistake happens, the team can go back to the last working version easily.
# What is problem Before Git
Before Git, developers managed code manually by copying and sharing files.
There was no version history, no proper backup, and no safe collaboration
As projects grew and more people worked together, code management became confusing and risky
