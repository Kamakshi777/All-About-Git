# Introduction to Git

## Why Git is Important
Git is used to track changes in code and help developers work together without breaking each other’s work.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine a team building a website:
- **A** updates the homepage
- **B** adds a contact form
- **C** fixes a bug on the login page

With Git, all their changes can be combined safely. If a mistake happens, the team can revert to the last working version easily.

## Problems Before Git
Before Git, developers managed code manually by copying and sharing files.
- No version history
- No proper backup
- No safe collaboration

As projects grew and more people worked together, code management became confusing and risky.
