## Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

Git allows you to:

### 1. Track changes in your files
- Each commit is a snapshot of the project at a given time.

### 2. Work with multiple developers simultaneously
- Branching lets each developer work independently and merge later.

### 3. Maintain history and backups
- Every developer has a full copy of the repository, avoiding a single point of failure.

### 4. Recover from mistakes
- You can revert to previous commits anytime.
