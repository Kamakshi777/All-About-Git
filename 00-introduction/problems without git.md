## 1. Maintaining Separate Files
Before Git, every version of a file had to be saved separately.

Examples:

## Git_Course.docx
## Git_Course_v1.docx
## Git_Course_v2.docx
## Git_Course_final.docx



This is messy and hard to manage.

**Git** allows version control within a single file, so you don’t need multiple copies.

---

## 2. Collaboration
Files only exist on one computer.  

Sharing changes with others is difficult and error-prone.  

**Git** allows multiple developers to work together safely, even on the same file.

---

## 3. Reliability
Old system had a single point of failure (if your computer crashes, all files could be lost).  

**Git** is distributed, meaning every developer has a full copy of the project.  

This avoids data loss and makes the system more reliable.
